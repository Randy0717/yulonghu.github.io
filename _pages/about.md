Hi! This is Yulong Hu! I am now a third year Ph.D. candidate at The Hongkong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), with the insightful guidance of Prof. Sen Li, and the exciting sponsorship of Hong Kong Ph.D. Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS) and HKUST Redbird Award. My research interests mainly lie in Reinforcement Learning (RL) Control and its potentials in emerging urban systems like Transportation and Power Systems. Currently, I am also now conducting my Ph.D. visit at Department of Informatics of King's College London, hosted by Prof. Yali Du. 

Before embarking on my doctoral journey, I obtained my bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation from the Hongshen Honor School at Chongqing University. I was also exchange undergraduate student in Electronic and Electrical Engineering at Sungkyunkwan University and Mathematics at The University of Hong Kong, respectively.
